##Nvapi.Net
Nvapi.Net is a wrapper around Nvidia's GPU comunications library. As of right now it does not include the nvapi.h or other nvidia header file which can be found on thier site. You will also need the DirectX_SDK to compile right now. I am going to make that optional in the future just for the need features but not now. Right now the project is still and the very early stages doing research coding and I am trying to decided to go with a c++\cli wrapper or try and make the project with CoreCLR compatability in mind.
